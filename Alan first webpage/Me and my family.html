		  <p  class="FitImage"><img src="images/6.jpg" alt=""/>
        <p>These are my friends. There were only two boys in our class, which was awkward at first, but as time went on, my relationship with the girls became more harmonious. They would talk to me and play games. When I encounter problems that I can't, I can also ask them for advice.&nbsp;Each of them has their own personality, everyone is different, but everyone is very warm and friendly to their friends.</p>
	    <p  class="FitImage"><img src="images/7.jpg" alt=""/>
        <p>This is my younger brother, who is almost ten years younger than me. He is a lively and cheerful little boy who loves sports. He plays badminton, soccer and cycling. Playing football at their school before, he also got a good result. He is also a good hand when it comes to learning. He received a certificate of outstanding student every semester. This picture is of him participating in a math competition.</p>
	      <p>
	        <p  class="FitImage"><img src="images/8.jpg" alt=""/>
	          <p>This is my dad and mom. Both of them are young. My dad was working at Audi, and he was the general manager of that department. He was very friendly with his colleagues, as they were all apprentices he brought out. My dad has been with Audi for almost fifteen years and has worked there since I was in kindergarten. My mother changed jobs a lot, including as a costumer and at the Ningbo Opera House. But then she couldn't eat her body and went to work somewhere else. My parents valued my brother and I very much, and they thought that studying was the easiest job and that it was easier to get a job.</p>
